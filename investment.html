                    <h2>SBICs invest in small businesses</h2>
                    <p>An SBIC is a privately owned company that’s licensed and regulated by the BPAK. SBICs invest in small businesses in the form of debt and equity. The BPAK doesn’t invest directly into small businesses, but it does provide funding to qualified SBICs with expertise in certain sectors or industries. Those SBICs then use their private funds, along with BPKA-guaranteed funding, to invest in small businesses.

                      <h3>What SBIC offers</h3>
                      SBICs invest in small businesses through debt, equity, or a combination of both. Debt is a loan an SBIC gives to a business, which the business must pay back, along with any interest. Equity is a share of ownership an SBIC gets in a business in exchange for providing funding. Sometimes, an SBIC invests in a business through both debt and equity. Such an investment includes both loans and shares of ownership. A typical SBIC investment is made over a 3-year period.
